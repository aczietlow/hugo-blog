I enjoy a good candlelit dinner, long walks on the beach, and diving head first into interesting code. I believe the oxford comma isn't optional and that there's a special place in hell for people that don't rinse ketchup off of their plates

I use this blog to document interesting things I build with code, chronicle my adventures, share cute puppy pictures, and occasionally share my opinions.
