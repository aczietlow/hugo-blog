Drupal is and has always been a double-edged sword. When it comes to the construction of a new project, Drupal really shines; with its boundless contributed modules, and rich core APIs. What ever the task, there's absolutely a tool, or likely several, for the task at hand. On the other hand stepping into an established Drupal site to make a modification can seem like a labyrinth of endless possibilities. Have a page that was constructed with views not returning the correct rendered results? The problem could be views configuration, custom plugins, query alters, numerous hooks, form alters, or any litany of overrides or hooks.
