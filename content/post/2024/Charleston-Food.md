It's a Thursday night, and I'm looking for a great dining experience with my wife. A colleague is in town and wants to sample "a unique Charleston experience." Most common yet, friends are coming in from up north and are asking for a recommendation. What follows is my personal list of food recommendations for the Charleston area.
