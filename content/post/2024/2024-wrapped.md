I'm writing this on behalf of future Chris. It's far and beyond time that past Chris and future Chris reconcile their differences. Present day Chris is exhausted from being caught in the middle. In a less whimsical and more practical sense I've felt off my game since late 2019. There may, possibly be a correlation between this shift in my life satisfaction levels and some major global event, but who is to say. 

Over the past four years I've prescribed to the philosophy of "reach for the stars... even if you stumble you'll land in the clouds". While this has worked well for me in the past, in has not yielded the ideal results. 2024 marked a year of change, growth, and new experimentation. At a high level I'd like to think I was able to recenter myself and drastically improve life satisfaction.
