From my perch looking out at the state of technology has been in an arm race for data over the decade. Upon reflecting on my footprint of data and web persona over the decades I realize that much of that has been lost over my lifetime. I ceded **control** of my data to various platforms, some of which are no longer around, some of which have drastically changed what they do with content I've shared with them, and all of which could change overnight without my input. Practically this has manifested itself in two outcomes. Some content I created on external platforms is gone forever, and some of that content is practically gone. There has to be a better way! Enter the IndieWeb. The IndieWeb is a community based on a set of tenants around.

If you don't own your data and rely on a platform to maintain it on your behalf, your data will eventually disappear and die. I'm looking at your Xanga, GeoCities, MySpace, and Google Plus. While most of this is fine, what's unfortunately is that I did not get to review or make that decision. Perhaps I would have made the decision to delete it as well, but I would have preferred the choice. Beyond entire platforms shutting down this can also be effected by data retention policies of platforms. Slack and Discord communities can get shutdown. Facebook groups can be deleted. Google will [delete](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725438/google-gmail-deleting-inactive-accounts) your Gmail account if you don't log in for two years. All of this is in the best interest of those platforms. To best support your personal data the option is clear; own your data.

One of the best ways to own your data is to acquire a domain, create your **website**, and post your content.
