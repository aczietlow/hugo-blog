After the passing of our previous dog, Linux at the end of the year, Alaina and I decided it was time to find our remaining dog Lexie a new companion. While we've raised puppies before, in many ways this will be a new experience for us. In the past we've always picked up a dog from a local shelter, but after much discussion we both agreed that we would love a golden retriever, so a golden retriever is what we got. Additionally, it will be an opportunity for us to learn from our earlier training of Lexie and Linux. While they are both loved and well-behaved dogs, there are few behavior quirks that we'd like to improve on, given the opportunity. 

While Cooper already brings companionship for Lexie, and some additional joy for Alaina and I, we both embark on the following weeks knowing we'll be surviving on poor sleep, and tried patience.
