- went to SELF in NC - Conferences are always a great recharge for me, and this one with forever hold a special place in my heart 
  - Saw so many great talks, discussed Matrix, Rust, all things Homelab, docker & K8s, LLMs, Ollama and more 
- Visited a MicroCenter - picked up enough HDDs to build a raid storage block on my homelab server, and a gorgeous new fractal case
- Bootstrapped on HTMX, Echo Server, and air in order to build out indieAuth client and website
- Ate some amazing food while in Charlotte
