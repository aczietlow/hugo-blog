  - Enjoyed a slower pace and unplugging a bit with Alaina

- Made some real headway on my indie auth client and server
  - go is such a fun language to really dive into

Self reflection while on my trip with Alaina, I really began to ponder on how thin I allow myself to be stretched throughout the week. I end up juggle so much I only manage to give things 50-75% of my full focus. While things still get accomplished, I think I find greater fulfillment and better outcomes when I am able to bring 100% of my focus and attention to what I'm working on at any given time.
