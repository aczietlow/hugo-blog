## Insights Upon Reflection

My energy levels and motivation have been falling behind the levels I would like for them to be. This has been the case for the previous 3 weeks, which aligns with a ramp up in demands from work. Anecdotally, this coincides with the lack of any real exercise over the past 3 weeks and piss poor diet. Now that my shins are healed, I'm going to fall back into my running routine, as that seems to be a good base upon which to build upon.
