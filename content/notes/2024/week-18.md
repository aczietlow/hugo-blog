## Weekly Thoughts

This week started out of sorts and off routine, and continued to run further off course as it progressed. The massive headache and total sleep exhaustion were likely the catalyst, and trying to keep the ship afloat as it were through the rest of the week helped to ensure that it stayed on course for that. Looking to control what I can, I'm going to shift back into my race training routine, and revert back to higher levels of tracking my health. I can't control the sleep schedule from Cooper, but I can control things like my diet and exercise habits. My hopes are that will help me to refocus, clear some of the mental fog, and hopefully reduce the likelihood of another week long migraine headache.
