In large I'm still adjusting to a world without my grandmother around, but carrying on. Pulling from my recent research from Csikszentmihalyi and Cal Newport I'm focused heavily on living a deeper, more rewarding life. Researching theory, crafting future experiments, and making plans are always the easier parts of the process. Approaching week 3 of some of my latest experiments and new plan, is where excitment starts to give way some and discipline starts to be required on the process of forming new habits. 

- Officially kicked off 2025 bridge run training
- Implemented "office hours" block at work
  - Getting use to a dedicated block schedule is going to take some getting use to still
  - On the days I stuck with it, I think it was highly successful
- Bought several 4kUHD movies from B&N while they were on sale
- signed up for a shared vacation with Alaina's family this summer
  - I've wanted to spend more time with them this year
- Continued typing practice at target goals
  - Have more than once successfully tested at 85 WPM
  - going to shift back to a slower speed to improve more accuracy
- Cracked through more sort, search algorithms
- further experimented on smoked chicken recipe
- hung out with friends, went to Lewis BBQ in downtown
