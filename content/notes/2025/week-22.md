I'm starting to emerge from a slump of uncertainty and stress back into a normal cadence - which includes catching back up on my weekly online journaling. 2025 has been marked by extreme change tinged by hardships. Losing 2 grandparents in the past 6 months, both pillars in my life and identity has been challenging. Coupled with the life altering change that I'll officially be a Dad at the end of this year has been a large amount of change in a short period of time. I feel like I'm cresting the ridge of the tumultuous times, transitioning to a more forward looking mindset. While I wish both of those grandparents could have shared this time in my life, I'm comforted by the person they've helped me become. With their help, and the help of the rest of my extended family I feel equipped with the fundamental ability to tacklet this next stage of my life
