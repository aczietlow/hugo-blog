This week was yet another very low energy week. I'm starting to wonder if I was sick without symptoms. I would prescribe a regement of additional sleep, more exercise, and finding more time in activities that energize myself. To that end, I carved out additional time throughout the week to work on writing code, both in the form of the bookworm project that I'm working on, as well as trying to write a oauth client/playground for day of learning at work.

- starting making a point to walk the dogs more throughout the week

- watched
  - S2 of Reacher

    - This is one of those movies that stuck in my thoughts for days afterward
