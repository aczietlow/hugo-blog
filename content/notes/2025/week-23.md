Overall a week marked by exhaustion and new exercise routine. Focusing on diet, exercise, and sleep continue to be my top priority for the month. The theory is that it will improve my energy levels, allowing me to accomplish more of the weekly and daily goals on my plate right now. Additionally I think it will best prepare me for world of fatherhood.

- walked 61,271 steps out of 77,000 target
- got a couple of 5am walks in for the week
- ran 7.23 miles / 7 mile target
  - I'm trying to target a 9:30/mi pace to build up ankle and shins
  - Struggling to run at a lower speed
- 3 gym sessions
- doing better at not eating as much sugar
- Spent all day Saturday with Alaina in the garden
  - got all the front garden plants in
  - cut front & back yard + applied fertilizer to front yard 
- Hosted friends on Sunday to celebrate impending baby
- had break through discovery at Cooper's dog training
  - While not food motivated, he is very motivated by a good stick
- After a couple of weeks I restarted the bookworm side project
  - Resolved a couple of bugs, and started scaffolding out the UI 
- Watched:
  - Finished the last 2 episodes of Clarkson's Farm
- Read:
  - a couple of chapter of The Anxious Generation
- Listened:
  - Econtalk with Russ Roberts: Nature vs. Nurture (with Paul Bloom)
    - Presented the this is a question without an answer
    - Mentioned book A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell
  - Deep Questions with Cal Newport: The Workload Fairytale
    - Mental work doesn't occur in 8 hour uninterrupted blocks like maybe physical labor can
    - take/make time to focus, make time for administration work, and take time for solitude
      - take walks during the work day
    - Focus on the work that is promotion worthy
      - This is an interesting low-pass filter for sorting through work that needs to get done
