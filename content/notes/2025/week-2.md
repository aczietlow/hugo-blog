summary: "New Year; New Routines"
---

I'm not one that buys into the hype of New Year's resolutions. The ticking over the calendar year does nothing to change who we all fundamentally are at the core. That's not to say that I'm not interested in self-improvement and contsant goal setting. Just that attempting to measure success in yearly increments is way too large, and a recipe for failure. To combat this I typically set my goals in monthly, and quarterly increments. I'll do an annual review in late November or December to beat the crowd. This year due to family obligations, I find myself starting later than normal. I've been in a very self-reflective mood since the passing of my grandmother on Dec 6.
