summary: "Rolling into 2025"

After taking almost three weeks of time with my family to process and work through the death of my grandmother, the first week of the new year marks the return to normalcy. Not that life without her is anything but normal right this moment. Time marches on, as they say. If there was anyone in my life that has prepared me for life's bumpy roads, it was that woman.
