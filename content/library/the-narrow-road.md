summary: "Bast knows how to bargain. The give-and-take of a negotiation is as familiar to him as the in-and-out of breathing; to watch him trade is to watch an artist at work. But even a master's brush can slip. When he accepts a gift, taking something for nothing, Bast's whole world is knocked askew, for he knows how to bargainâ€”but not how to owe."

Follows the adventures of Bast doing Bast things around the Waystone inn. A fun small expansion of the character Bast meandering through the his day. He really is the dashing, conniving rouge.
