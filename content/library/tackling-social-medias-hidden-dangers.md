### Recap

Cal discusses the impact of the youth ban on social media in Australia, and really dives into the big picture of the motivation behind such a new regulation. Discusses downsides of social media, such as the faux-social connections it triggers in our brains, and how this further ties into the loneliness epidemic experienced in America.

### My Notes

- with social media comes a lot of inherent risk
  - It's like a digital slot machine
    - This is why all social media companies are utilizing algorithmic feeds.
    - It's not about serving you something you want to see; it's about pulling the slot machine lever (swiping down) and finding that nugget that feels like the jackpot
  - This is especially a risk for the youth without fully developed frontal cortices
  - Uses the phrase **digital fentanyl** when describing social media use
- folks taking the other of the argument that social media is a town square
  - social media is not the Internet
