### Recap

Digital Minimalism, by Cal Newport, focused on applying the ideals of the minimalism moment to a chaotic, digital world. I picked this up as a continuation of my interest and focus on achieving a happier life. Cal would use the phrase "deep life." Digital minimalism isn't about technological luddite, so much as it is about spending our limited time on higher areas of return. This really further highlights that our time on this Earth and specifically our time is a zero sum game.  

Through anecdotal experiences, and storytelling Cal explores both sides of the trade we've all made in giving up our time and attention to exist in a state of constant inter-connectivity. Digital Minimalism is not the cutting edge research nor is it meant to be a definitive how-to guide. It served much better as a thought provoking read, offering more of general direction and speed at which changes could yield a positive impact.
