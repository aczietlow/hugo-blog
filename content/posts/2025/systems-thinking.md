## Systems Thinking

## Working notes

Chapter 3: shifting perspective
- The iceberg model makes me think of the 5 whys.
- why do so many authors feel the need to have numbered lists.
  - "here's 5 practices to change your life"
    - but in this case "here's also a secret 6th one too"
- Referenced the book The Deep Work by Cal Newport
  - +1 to this in general
  - also references The Anxious Generation by Jonathon Haidt
- like that he references successful team have an adversion to refusing to think well/deep
  - this aligns with the bottom up approach that has worked well for us in the past
  - Aligns with the affiliative and democratic management style I align with the most [leadership styles](/library/leadership-that-gets-results)
    - team first, focus more on culture, team relationships, and bonds
    - structure will dictate the design of solutions
  - "no one gets to be a cat"
    - teams shouldn't need cat herding or glue (most of the time)
- "Modeling" thinking about a system visually
  - represent our thinking of a system - not reality
  - should also be defensible though
- have played the "beer game" in a previous training
