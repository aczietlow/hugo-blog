### Abstract

I invest too much of my time into low value, low reward activities. This can be doom scrolling Twitter, reading the latest drama on reddit, or getting sucked into a rabbit hole on Youtube. Sometimes this takes the form of playing a mindless game, or getting sucked into binge watching something on Netflix. I've become addicted to technology. In order to optimize my life for satisfaction, joy, and virtue I need to find a more rigid role for media and technology. To start I'll establish a new baseline, or foundation upon which to build upon.  

Plan: Embark on 30 days of digital detox

### Rules 

1. No television/video streaming
2. No social media
3. No music streaming outside of work
4. No Android Auto while drive 
  - look up directions before hand
  - use in cases of actual emergency
5. No solo video games
  - Can continue Friday game night
6. Fall asleep without headphones

### Practices

1. Collect interesting articles throughout the week
  - Saturday mornings, go out for coffee and reading
2. Go on long walks without the dogs
  - also with the dogs
3. Consolidate texting to small windows in the morning and evenings
  - communication should be intentional, focused, and require real effort
4. Engage in more higher demanding leisure time activities
  - higher the effort -> the higher the reward
5. Join "something" new
6. Embrace hobbies away from the screen


### Conclusion

At the conclusion I hope to reevaluate the role of media and technology is going to play within my life going forward.
