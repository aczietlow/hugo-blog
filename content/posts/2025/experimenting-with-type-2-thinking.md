### Abstract

In trying to continue optimize my daily routine and adjust to the reality of looming parenthood the thing I find myself wanting more than anything is "increased heads down time." That is time that I can carve out where I can force everything else from my mind and focus deeply solving a singular problem, ideally in a minimum of 1.5 hour blocks. What I feel is holding me from such a thing is 3 fold:

Internet toil - the burning of my time stumbling down yet another Reddit rabbit hole, a YouTube binge sessions, or becoming entirely too interested in a topic that brings no value to my life.

Working toil - the churn and burn of feeling like I'm accomplishing a lot while working, while in reality spending all of my mental capacity on context switching between the task at hand, slack, emails, one-off requests, house-hold chores, etc

Health toil - my physical fitness and overall health isn't in an ideal state. Acks and pains, lower energy levels, and reduced mental concentration are an obvious area for improvement

This is reminicent of Daniel Kahneman's concept of System thinking, where system 1 thinking is for fast pattern recognition tasks, and system 2 thinking requires more analytical attention. The system 2 thinking is what I crave most, and what I want to optimize towards. 

In looking at the above friction points there's an underlying theme to the next 30 days, everything should be in service of increase time available for system 2 thinking. This will include removing distractions, automating/out sourcing tasks where there is little to no value in my attention, improving cognative fitness, and replacing type 1 fun with more type 2 fun. 

Let me explain that last part. I'm not foolish enough to assume that I plot every minute of my day towards productivity, and replace all idle rest and relaxation time with deal analytical problem solving. As with physical exercise the key to performance is exertion effort followed by periods of active recovery. While muscle recover NEEDS rest it benefits more from active recovery. After intense exercise it's been found that it's optimal for recovery to both not further excert the same muscle group, and to perform light activity such as walking, as opposed to laying on the couch eating potato chips, and binging Netflix. I want to apply this same concept to my rest and relaxation time; classifying in a simliar system. It's relaxing to sit in the shade and scroll through reddit for an hour (Type 1), it's more rewarding to read fiction (Type 2). There are types of relaxation that have a more pronouced impact on my recovery than others.


Plan: Embark on another 30 experiment to increase time spent in system 2 problem solving
